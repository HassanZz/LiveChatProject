## in this project I used:
* [bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) to facilitate writing css
* [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) as backend of this project.
* [babel](https://babeljs.io/) compiler to make new JavaScript features recognizable to all browsers.
* [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) (wrapper or bundler) to compile all scattered code together.
* modern javaScript features( like arrow functions, ...)
* Object-oriented programming
* Promises (async & await)
* Fetch and http requests
* ...
